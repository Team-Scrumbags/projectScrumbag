# project Scrumbag

# Mission Plan
- An optional collaborative project that aims to give an opportunity to work on other topics for those who are mostly done with their Deep Dives. 
- With focus on working in GitHub, with a stronger focus on the Scrum framework, and the headaches involved with collaborating with others to write code together.
- Project will aim to provide scrum members with interesting project ideas that deliver useful products for the Scrumbags, whilst also being maintainable and accessible for new members without needing prior knowledge.
- Made predating the official project "Project" and alongside it, but with the same results in mind.
